Part I of the assignment are theoretical problems. See handout for more information.


Part II of the assignment implements a rudimentary edge detection process which uses the derivative of Gaussian.  

A1.py contains all the code to steps 1-4 of part 2 of the assignment. 

To run the code, make the required imports as displayed at the top of the file. The image path constants should be already assigned. If not, then ensure that the paths are pointing to the correct file path of the images in the "images" folder.

The required functions are defined in the A1.py file (for steps 1-3) and step 4 includes all the tests. Running the A1.py file would also run these tests. The outputs of the tests (the images) are all saved as jpg files in the root folder.
