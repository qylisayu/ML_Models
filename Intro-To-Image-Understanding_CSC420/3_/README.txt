The zipped folder is too big to submit on Markus if I include the output images of Q3.py, so I only included the output .txt files for Q3. 

To get the output images, simply re-run the python file. The code to generate each all files can be found in each of the folders. All image paths should be correct given the directory set up as is submitted. 


To run the code, simply make the required imports as displayed at the top of the .py files, and all images/text files should be outputted to the appropriate question's folder.
