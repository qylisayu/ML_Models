Learn about word embeddings and make neural networks learn about words. 
1. try to match statistics about the words
2. train a network that takes a sequence of words as input and learns to predict the word that comes next.

Implementation of a linear embedding and the backpropagation computations for a neural language model. Also includes experiments to analyze the learned representation.
